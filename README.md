# hoosk Discord Bot
What started as a simple support ticket app, and became a general purpose chatbot that I use for me and my friends Discord server.
Currently supports several basic functions and slash commands, and is designed to work on the AWS platform with support for AWS Secrets (some code tweaks will be required) or by using system environment variable if present.
